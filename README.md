# cs4720-android
[Project Description](https://cs4720.cs.virginia.edu/android.html)

## Final build (2/15/16)

#### Things your app must have:

- [x] When the app starts up, the user should be presented with a list of things to do
- [x] There needs to be obvious indication in the list as to whether a particular item has been completed or not (not just on the separate info page)
- [x] There should be some easy way from the list to check off that you have done that item
- [x] The app does not necessarily need to remember what items were checked off
- [ ] Tapping on an item in the list should bring up another page that shows information about the item
- [ ] The info displayed should be at least a title/name of the item, a short description, and whether it is complete or not
- [ ] You should also be able to check off that something has been completed from its info page
- [ ] The app must be able to be run on other devices (i.e. youâ€™ll need to create a signed .apk for installation)
- [x] ~~Groups of 3 are expected to add more features on top of this list - ask staff for ideas if you need them~~
- [x] ~~Groups of 3 should explain their added features in their documentation~~

## Milestone (2/8/16)

#### App Requirements:

- [x] There should be a list that displays at the very least test data
- [x] Items should be able to be marked as complete or not (this does not have to be saved between runs)
